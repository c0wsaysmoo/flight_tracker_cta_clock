# flight_tracker_cta_clock
clock that uses rbg panel to display cta trains/weather/time/ and planes overhead
The flight information can be found on my other project. The two numbers in the corner are the current temp and the color is the humidity outside. IE blue is 100% humid and white is 0%. The number under that is change of rain within the hour and the color is the change of rain in the day. could say 0% but be blue means no rain right now but will later on. On the bottom shows the next 3 trains in both directions. The number will turn green when the train is "due" will say "DL" if delayed and will turn red if its estimated and not actual. 

The time will change color at sunrise and sunset, and the date displays the moonphase. More info can be found in the flight tracker project including better instructions


youll need to import the "logos" folder from the plane tracker project. I dont feel like uploading them all twice.
